  <div class="lesson"><h2 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1: Basics of HTML</h2> </div>
  <div class="concept"> <b>The WWW</b><br></div>

  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Basic components comprising the web are: HTML, URLS, HTTP and Web Apps.</em></div><br>
<div class="concept-description"><p>HTML is a hypertext markup language and is the main type of document on the web.  
Types of files found on web include; plain text, images, videos and music. 
  </p></div>
  <div class="concept"><b>HTML</b><br></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>HTML is made up of tags and elements.</em></div> <br>
<div class="concept-description"><p>There are several types of tags, the most important thing to remember about different types of tags
is that they do not have to be remembered! <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> is your friend for finding a tag 
that you have forgotten.  Elements usually have an opening and closing tag, however some tags do not require
a closing tag.  A tag that does not need a closing tag is called a void tag.  A couple of examples of void tags
  are the image tag, &lt;img&gt;, and the break tag &lt;br&gt;.  I just used <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> to figure out
  how to show tags in text 
  ;)!  Multiple tags can be nested.</p></div>

  <div class="concept-brief"><em>White Space</em></div> <br>
 <div class="concept-description"><p>
  White space can be achieved using the &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags.  The &lt;br&gt; is an inline tag and needs no closing
   tag. The &lt;p&gt; tag is a block tag and requires closing tag &lt;/p&gt;.</p> </div>

  <div class="concept"><b>Key point</b><br></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Computers are stupid</em></div><br>
  <div class="concept-description"><p>Computers will do exactly what I tell them to do, as long as I am speaking their language!
    While learning to code may not be as much fun as learning Italian, it will be much more useful for the 
    long haul.  
    </p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3 id="lesson-2">Lesson 2: Creating structured documents using HTML</h3></div>
  <div class="concept"> <b>HTML Structure</b></div><br></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>HTML is the language of the web; syntax and rules</em></div><br>
    <div class="concept-description"><p>HTML elements are always rectangular even if they do not appear that way.  Thinking of text in terms of boxes
    will help with web planning.  HTML boxifys the web.  These boxes are defined by the  &lt;div&gt; tag.  Each box starts
      with &lt;div&gt; and ends with &lt;/div&gt;.</p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>DOM</b><br></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Document Object Model</em></div><br>
    <div class="concept-description"><p>DOM is the tree-like structure of a page.  The tree is organized into <em>parent</em>and 
      <em>child</em> nodes.  The DOM tree is upside down with root at the top and branches underneath.  
      </p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>CSS</b><br></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></div><br>
    <div class="concept-description"><p>CSS is the style language.  The look and formatting of a document are determined using CSS.</p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>Key point</b></div><br>
    <div class="concept-description"><p>Chrome shows the developers tool! Click on the the 3 bars on the top right of the <a href="www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> 
    tool bar. Then click tools and developers tools.  <b>Viola</b> the tree is displayed!  
    Being a novice I thought this was pretty cool.  The tree is displayed on the left and the CSS
      language on right.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h4>Lesson 3: Adding CSS style to HTML structure</h4></div>
<div class="concept"> <b>Spaces Matter!</b></div><br>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Spaces Matter!</em></div><br>
     <div class="concept-description"><p>This may seem like repetition to someone else reading, but this was my first major mistake.  I was driven
       batty for a bit until I figured out I had too many spaces.  So <b>Spaces Matter.</b>
         .description { color : red; } will not work if there is an extra <b>space</b>.  Spaces Matter.
       </p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>Search and Replace</b></div><br>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>CSS is the find a replace of coding. </em></div><br>
  <div class="concept-description"><p>Breaking CSS down into the simplest understanding; a class of the element is entered, how it should be styled
  is setup, then CSS will match the formatting for other elements with the same class.
    </p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>Order Matters</b></div><br>
      <div class="concept-brief"><em>Order and rules go together in code much like they go together in life.</em></div><br>
  <div class="concept-description"><p>  Styles are defined in different places.</p> </div>
      <div class="concept-list"><ol>
        <li>Browser default style</li>
        <li>Stylesheet in a separate file.</li>
        <li>Sytlesheet inside the HTML file</li>
        <li>Inline with the element</li>
        </ol> </div>     

<div class="concept"><b>Specifics Matter</b></div><br> 
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Inheritance</em></div><br>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>With inheritance, styles are applied to a specific element (parent) and its descendants (child). This
      helps alleviate repetition in code.  An important note, descendants inherit text related properties, but not
        box properties.
        </p></div>
  <div class="concept"><b>Repetition</b></div><br> 
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Don't make me repeat myself</em></div><br>
  <div class="concept-description"><p>Repetition is bad, using CSS to avoid it is good.  
    CSS allow the program writer to have a consistent style without constant repetition.  This is 
    accomplished by linking a CSS style sheet to the HTML document. 
        </p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>Code, Test, Refine</b></div><br>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>If at first you don't succeed...</em></div><br>
  <div class="concept-description"><p>Basic steps in coding:</p></div>
        <div class="concept-list"><ol>
        <li>Look for the boxes</li>
        <li>Look for repeats; style and semantic elements</li>
        <li>Write HTML</li>
        <li>Apply styles from biggest to smallest</li>
        <li>Fix what's broken</li>
          </ol></div>
        <div class="concept-description"><p>Code comments in CSS begin with /* and end with */.
          </p></div>
<div class="concept"><b>It's all about the BOX</b></div><br>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>And how it fits inside</em></div><br>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>Width of the box is left border, left padding, width of content, right padding and right border.
      This can be a challenge to keep recalculating, so we have border box (*{box-sizing: border-box;})
      Border box includes border and padding and adjusts as necessary. No matter how you change the border 
      and padding the size of the box stays the same.  The margin is not included.  I never did figure out how 
      to change the margin.  I was not able to edit in dev tools, so if you are reading this and could give
      me some guidance it would be greatly appreciated, I figure it will be important later. 
        </p></div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>Not all browsers understand border box since it is relatively new.  Specific browser prefixes need to be 
        included. <br>
        *{
<div class="concept-list">
     -webkit- box-sizing:  border-box;<br>

-moz- box-sizing:  border-box;<br>
-ms- box-sizing:  border-box;<br>
box-sizing:  border-box;
} <br>
        </div>

  </div><br>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Key points about box sizing</em></div><br>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>Each HTML element is a box with 4 components, seems like geometry to me.  Since there are so
        many components to juggle, it can be challenging to get the size of the box just right.  Boxes can
        be set to a percent rather than pixels, or use border-box.  
        </p></div>
  <div class="concept-brief"><em>Box positioning</em></div><br>
      <div class="concept-description"><p> Divs are block elements and will take up the entire width of a page.  Adding the rule display: flex; will 
        allow divs to appear next to each other. 
        </p></div>
